# Jarvis Homemade Assistant
Just trying to have fun creating an homemade assistant using Chat GPT API.

# Goals
[x] - Be faster. Complicated because it's the time that take ChatGPT that slow everything  
[x] - Connect my ESP32 devices to control my house with the assistant  
[x] - Connect it to internet for meteo and news (can't use GPT for this)  
[x] - Deploy it on a Raspberry Pi  

# How to use it
At this point it's a very simple code. Change the prefix if you don't want to use Jarvis.
After using : $ pip install -r requirements.txt, you can run the code with : $ python3 main.py.
After saying a sentence starting with "you_prefix", ChatGPT will answer (it can take a moment).
